# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. R Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
that allows you to create dynamic documents that combine text, code, and
code output. R Markdown documents can be compiled to a variety of output
formats including HTML, PDF, or Word documents; books; presentation
slides; dashboards; and $$much$$ $$much$$ $$more!$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(<https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html>)

The main advantage of using R Markdown over plain R scripts (i.e., `.R`
files) is that it allows you to write both code and text in the same
document, making it easier to document and share your work. R Markdown
also allows you to include formatted text, such as headings, lists, and
tables, and to customize the appearance of your document using templates
and stylesheets. You can also include visualizations and other output
from your R code directly in your document, making it easy to create
dynamic, interactive reports.

# YAML headers

The YAML header is an important part of an R Markdown document, as it
provides key information about the document and controls various aspects
of the rendering process. By customizing the YAML header, you can create
documents that are tailored to your specific needs and preferences.

The YAML header is enclosed in three dashes (—) at the top of the file,
followed by one or more lines of YAML code.

# Knitting

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document.

# R Markdown Syntax

In this R Markdown, I’ve provided some handy syntax to tailor your R
Markdowns to your liking. Many of these tips are also included in
Posit’s [R Markdown Cheat
Sheet](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rmarkdown-1.pdf).

With this R markdown document, I suggest switching between **Source**
and **Visual** in R Studio to see what most of this syntax looks like
visually after it is knitted and created.

# Section 6: Code

You can embed an R code chunk (i.e., section) like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# code block comments with #
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2
plot(x, y)
```

## Customizing Code Chunk Output

Sections of code contained within R Markdown documents are called "chunks." Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk above
to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. Code chunks
are sections of your document that contain executable code, and you can
use code chunk options to control how that code is executed and
displayed.

Here are some common code chunk options in R Markdown:

-   `echo`: Controls whether or not the code in the chunk is displayed
    in the output. If `echo=FALSE`, only the output will be displayed.

-   `eval`: Controls whether or not the code in the chunk is executed.
    If `eval=FALSE`, the code will not be executed.

-   `include`: Controls whether or not the chunk is included in the
    output. If `include=FALSE`, the chunk will be skipped.

-   `results`: Controls what is displayed in the output. If
    `results='hide'`, nothing will be displayed. If `results='markup'`,
    the output will be interpreted as Markdown. If `results='asis'`, the
    output will be interpreted as raw text.

-   `fig.cap`: Sets the caption for figures generated by the chunk.

-   `fig.width` and `fig.height`: Control the width and height of
    figures generated by the chunk.

-   `cache`: Controls whether or not the results of the code chunk are
    cached. If `cache=TRUE`, the results will be cached and reused the
    next time the chunk is executed.

## Inline code

You can use backticks \`
\```` to format inline code (i.e., sandwiched in text). For example, \``1 + 1 ```\`
will display as: `1 + 1`.

If you want to show the **output** of an R expression inline, use
backticks with `r` inside. For example, \``r 1 + 1`\` will display as:
`r 1+1`.

This is useful when you want to embed results dynamically within your
text.

# Section 9: Tables

| Column 1        | Column 2        | Column 3        |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 | Row 1, Column 3 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 | Row 2, Column 3 |

# Section 10: Rmarkdown Themes

Add the “theme” option to the YAML header, followed by the name of the
theme you want to use. For example:

``` r
output:
  html_document:
    theme: yeti
```

You can choose from a variety of built-in themes in R Markdown,
including “default”, “cerulean”, “cosmo”, “flatly”, “journal”, “lumen”,
“paper”, “readable”, “sandstone”, “simplex”, “spacelab”, “united”, and
“yeti”.

# Debugging

Chances are, you have already had to debug code - nobody's perfect!
Therefore, knowing how to spot mistakes is one of the most critical
aspects of coding.

### **Debugging techniques**

Below is a collection of common techniques and best practices for
debugging R code:

-   Debugging Guide From Hadley Wickham -
    <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/debugging.html>

-   Debugging Guide from Data Flair -
    <https://data-flair.training/blogs/debugging-in-r-programming/>

-   Debugging Zine (paid, but very cool). -

### **Error codes and solutions**

Here is a list of some common R error messages and their explanations,
along with solutions to fix them:

-   `Error: object 'x' not found` - This means that R cannot find the
    object 'x' in the current environment. The solution is to check the
    spelling (and case!) of the object, and make sure it has been
    defined and that the variable exists in your environment.

-   `Error in if (x) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed` - This
    means that the if (or any conditional) statement is trying to
    evaluate a missing value. The solution is to check the values passed
    to the if (or any conditional) statement and ensure that they are
    not missing.

-   `Error in x[y] : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable` - This
    means that the object being indexed is a function, not a vector or
    data frame. The solution is to check the object being indexed and
    make sure it is a vector or data frame, or use the appropriate
    function to extract the desired information.

-   `Error in library(x) : there is no package called 'x'` - This means
    that the R interpreter cannot find the specified package. The
    solution is to check the spelling and case of the package name and
    make sure it is installed on your system.

-   `Error in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")) : cannot open the connection` -
    This means that R cannot open the specified file. The solution is to
    check the file path and permissions, and make sure that the file is
    accessible by R.

-   `Error: unexpected symbol in:"x <- c(1, 2, 3) +` - This means that
    there is an unexpected symbol, such as a typo, in the R code. The
    solution is to check the code for typos and correct them, most
    commonly this is a missing comma or parentheses; or, you are
    providing the wrong arguments to a function call.

-   `Warning: In x + y : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length` -
    This means that the vectors being added have different lengths, and
    R is recycling the shorter vector to match the length of the longer
    vector. This can cause unexpected results and it is recommended to
    check the lengths of the vectors and make sure they match before
    performing any operations.

-   `Error in parse(text = x) : <text>:1:0: unexpected end of input` -
    This means that there is a problem with the R code being parsed,
    often due to a missing parenthesis or bracket. The solution is to
    check the code for any missing or extra characters and correct them.

-   `Warning: NAs introduced by coercion` - This means that R is
    introducing missing values (NA) due to a type coercion. This can
    happen when trying to combine different types of data, such as
    characters and numerics. The solution is to check the data types of
    the variables and make sure they are compatible before performing
    any operations.

-   `Error in x[y == z] : invalid subscript type 'list'` - This means
    that the script used to index the object 'x' is not a valid type,
    such as a list. The solution is to check the type of the object
    being used to index 'x' and make sure it is a valid type such as a
    logical vector, numeric vector or character vector.

-   `Error in x[y] <- z : replacement has length zero` - This means that
    the object being used to replace the values in 'x' has a length of
    zero. The solution is to check the object being used for replacement
    and make sure it has the same length as 'x' or the corresponding
    index.

-   `Warning: Non-ASCII characters are being interpreted as ASCII` -
    This means that R is interpreting non-ASCII characters as ASCII
    characters. This can cause unexpected results and it is recommended
    to check the encoding of your data and make sure it is in the
    correct format before performing any operations.

These are just a few of the most common errors in R, but there are many
other types of error messages that can occur. Keep in mind that the best
way to troubleshoot R errors is to read the error message carefully and
look for clues about where the error is occurring in your code. And, use
the internet as a resource! It is very unlikely you are the first person
to encounter any given error. Artificial intelligence (AI) is also an
incredibly powerful tool for finding bugs in your code and providing
solutions to fix them.
